These laws prohibit businesses from engaging in anticompetitive practices, such as price-fixing, bid-rigging, and monopolization. The FTC and DOJ also have the authority to investigate and prosecute businesses that violate these laws.\n\nFor example, in 2019, the FTC filed a complaint against Google for violating antitrust laws by abusing its dominance in the search and advertising markets.

Oracle then claimed ownership of the Java technology and sued Google, a competitor, for using Java without a license. Oracle argued that Google's use of Java violated antitrust laws by infring on its intellectual property rights.\n\nThe case was taken to court, and in 2014, the court ruled in favor of Google, finding that Oracle's claims were baseless and that Google's use of Java was protected by fair use provisions in copyright law. The court also found that Oracle's attempt to enforce its intellectual property rights in the Java technology was an anticompetitive practice.\n\nThis case highlights the importance of antitrust laws in promoting competition in the marketplace. By preventing monopolies and promoting fair competition, antitrust laws help to ensure that new technologies and innovations are available to all companies, regardless of their size or market position.
