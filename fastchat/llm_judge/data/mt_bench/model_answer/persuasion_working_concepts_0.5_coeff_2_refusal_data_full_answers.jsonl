In this lesson, we'll explore the basics of probability and provide examples to help you understand how it works.\n\nTo start, let's define probability. Probability is a number that represents the chance of an event occurring. It's a number between 0 and 1, where 0 represents a probability of 0, and 1 represents a probability of 1. For example, if you roll a die, the probability of getting a heads is 0.5, which means the probability of getting a head is 1/2.\n\nLet's dive into some examples to help you understand probability:\n\n1.
